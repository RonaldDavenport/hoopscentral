# How to use the site?
 - When navigating through the website. When you reach the Players page you will be greeted with a search bar. It will prompt you to enter an NBA players name. Upon entry, a stat card will show up below the search bar. This will contain your players name, height, position, team, and season statistics. Along with all this information a highlight video will appear as well.
